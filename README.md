## Context

In rugby, a common drill to warm up is "infinite passing". This is a drill where players will line up in lines (typically no more than 5 or 6) and pass the ball according to the following algoirthm. 

The ball starts on the leftmost line. 

1. the player with the ball passes to the adjacent right line
2. the player who just passed the ball goes to the end of the adjacent right line
3. repeat steps 1 and 2 until the ball reaches the rightmost line
4. the player with the ball passes to the adjacent left line 
5. the player who just passed the ball goes to the end of the adjacent left line
6. repeat steps 1-6

Below is a diagram of the drill running where the ball is passed 4 times (`-n->` indicates the n-th iteration). Each column is a line of players where each number is a unique player. A number with `b` immediately after it represents the player with the ball. For example, `1b` means player 1 has the ball. In the example below, the ball starts with player one who is the first player in the leftmost column. Player 4 is the second player in the leftmost column. Player 2 is the first player in the middle column.

## Problem

A common occurence in this drill is that one or more players will be stuck oscillating between two lines. This is happens when a player goes to the line they were just in without going all the way down to the last line. For example, if a player, Jeff, is in a drill with 5 lines and is the first person in the first line, Jeff would have oscillated one time if he were to pass (and subsequently join) line 2 and then pass to line 1 and join line 1 again. 

A key characteristic that determines whether a player will oscillate or not is whether the line they are entering has an odd or even number excluding that player. If Jeff passes the ball and goes to the end of a line with an odd number of players (excluding Jeff), his next turn would not result in an oscillation. Conversly, if Jeff were to enter a line with an even number of players (excluding himself), his next turn would not result in an oscillation. Below is a brief example. 

**Jeff enters an odd line** (example generated by the code in main)

## Approach

1. To gain intuition on the problem and potentially observe patterns, I am starting with a brute force approach where I am keeping track of which players oscillate.
